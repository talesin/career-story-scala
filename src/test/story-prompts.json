Ensure the final result clearly labels each section (Situation, Action, Result) and that the language is crisp and impactful. Give me three different versions for each section. If there isn't enough content to meet the 60 words ask questions to help me build it up and provide tips for improving it - do not make assumptions or embellish without facts:\n\n${story}"
